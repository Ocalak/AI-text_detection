Using language models: One way to detect AI generated text is to use language models like GPT-3.5, GPT-2, or BERT to compare the text you suspect to be AI-generated with text generated by humans. These models can identify patterns and features that are typical of AI-generated text, such as repetition of certain phrases, lack of coherence, or unusual grammar structures.
Using machine learning: Another approach is to use machine learning algorithms to train a classifier that can distinguish between human and AI-generated text. You can create a dataset of human-written text and AI-generated text, and use this dataset to train a binary classifier using techniques like logistic regression, support vector machines, or neural networks.
Using rule-based systems: You can also create a rule-based system that looks for specific features that are typical of AI-generated text. For example, you can look for repetitions of phrases or sentences, inconsistent use of grammar or syntax, or the use of uncommon or unusual words.
