A simple way to detect generated texts is by comparing several known generators and asking them to write the desired text.

Another hint would be to add some grammar mistakes to see if the tool understands its dataset since only humans make mistakes.

If you read many texts generated by artificial intelligence, you will notice they use the same grammar patterns.

You can instruct the generators to target other audiences, use active voices, etc.

You can then measure the words' distance, common words, etc.

After you compare it with a predicted threshold, you can check how confident we are the text was not generated by a human being.
